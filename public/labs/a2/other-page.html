    <h2>Designing a URL Shortening service like</h2>
    <p>
        TinyURL
        Let's design a URL shortening service like TinyURL. This service will provide short aliases redirecting
        to long URLs. Similar services: bit.ly, goo.gl, qlink.me, etc. Difficulty Level: Easy
        1. Why do we need URL shortening?
        URL shortening is used to create shorter aliases for long URLs. We call these shortened aliases “short
        links.” Users are redirected to the original URL when they hit these short links. Short links save a lot of
        space when displayed, printed, messaged, or tweeted. Additionally, users are less likely to mistype
        shorter URLs.
        For example, if we shorten this page through TinyURL:
        https://www.educative.io/collection/page/5668639101419520/5649050225344512/5668600
        916475904/
        We would get:
        http://tinyurl.com/jlg8zpc
        The shortened URL is nearly one-third the size of the actual URL.
        URL shortening is used for optimizing links across devices, tracking individual links to analyze
        audience and campaign performance, and hiding affiliated original URLs.
        If you haven’t used tinyurl.com before, please try creating a new shortened URL and spend some time
        going through the various options their service offers. This will help you a lot in understanding this
        chapter.
